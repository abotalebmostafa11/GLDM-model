
Residual Autocorrelation Plot
Autocorrelation calculates the strength of the relationship between an observation and observations at prior time steps.
We can calculate the autocorrelation of the residual error time series and plot the results. 
 This is called an autocorrelation plot.
We would not expect there to be any correlation between the residuals.
 This would be shown by autocorrelation scores being below the threshold of significance 
 (dashed and dotted horizontal lines on the plot).
visualizing the autocorrelation for the residual errors. 
 The x-axis shows the lag and the y-axis shows the correlation between an observation and the lag variable, 
 where correlation values are between -1 and 1 for negative and positive correlations respectively.
Residual Histogram and Density Plots
Plots can be used to better understand the distribution of errors beyond summary statistics.
 We would expect the forecast errors to be normally distributed around a zero mean. 
 Plots can help discover skews in this distribution. 
 We can use both histograms and density plots to better understand the distribution of residual errors.
